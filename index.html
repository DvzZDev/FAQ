          CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style language used to describe the visual presentation of an HTML (or XML) document. It allows controlling the appearance and layout of a web page, including color, font, spacing, size, and position of elements.

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

          CSS is crucial for modern web design. It enables separating the structure of an HTML document from its visual style, making it easier to create websites with consistent and professional designs. Additionally, it allows for style reuse, simplifying the maintenance and updating of large and complex websites.
        </p>
        <h2>Key features of CSS:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Element Selection:</strong> CSS allows selecting specific HTML elements and applying styles only to those elements.</li>
          <li><strong>Cascade:</strong> CSS rules are applied in a cascading manner, where styles can be inherited and overridden, allowing for flexible and modular styling.</li>
          <li><strong>Modularity:</strong> CSS promotes modularity by allowing styles to be defined separately from HTML content, making code more organized and maintainable.</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> CSS supports responsive design, allowing websites to adapt their layout and appearance based on the screen size and device type.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Browser Compatibility:</strong> CSS ensures consistency in the appearance of websites across different web browsers.</li>
