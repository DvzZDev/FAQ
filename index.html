              HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create
              and design web pages. It is the fundamental building block of any website
              on the Internet. HTML provides a basic structure for web content by using
              a series of elements and tags that define how information should be displayed
              in a web browser.

              CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style language used
              to describe the visual presentation of an HTML (or XML) document. It allows
              controlling the appearance and layout of a web page, including color, font,
              spacing, size, and position of elements.

              Why is it important?
            </h2>
            <p>
              CSS is crucial for modern web design. It enables separating the structure
              of an HTML document from its visual style, making it easier to create websites
              with consistent and professional designs. Additionally, it allows for style
              reuse, simplifying the maintenance and updating of large and complex websites.

                  Element Selection:
                </strong>
                CSS allows selecting specific HTML elements and applying styles only to
                those elements.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>
                  Cascade:
                </strong>
                CSS rules are applied in a cascading manner, where styles can be inherited
                and overridden, allowing for flexible and modular styling.

                CSS promotes modularity by allowing styles to be defined separately from
                HTML content, making code more organized and maintainable.

              JavaScript: An Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript is a programming language commonly used for adding interactivity
              to web pages. It allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, enabling
              dynamic and responsive user experiences.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Why is it important?
            </h2>
            <p>
              JavaScript is essential for modern web development. It enhances user interaction
              by enabling dynamic content updates, form validation, and asynchronous
              communication with servers, among other features.
            </p>
            <h2>
              Key features of JavaScript:
            </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript executes on the client-side (in the
                user's browser), reducing server load and improving responsiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                DOM Manipulation: JavaScript allows developers to modify the Document
                Object Model (DOM), enabling dynamic changes to the structure and content
                of web pages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Event Handling: JavaScript enables developers to respond to user actions,
                such as clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard inputs, by executing specific
                functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming,
                allowing tasks to be executed independently, improving performance and
                responsiveness.
              </li>
              <li>
                Modern Frameworks and Libraries: JavaScript has a rich ecosystem of frameworks
                and libraries (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) that streamline web development
                and enhance functionality.
